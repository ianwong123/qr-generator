# QR Generator

This is a tool to generate your own static QR codes.

It contains no ads and does not redirect you to any third-party websites. Any QR code you create is yours; it links directly to the destination you provide.

After generating a QR code, you can:
1. Download it as a pdf
2. Print the label directly
